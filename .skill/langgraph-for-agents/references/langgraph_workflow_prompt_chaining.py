GENERATE_MESSAGES_FROM_USER_PERSONA_PROMPT = """
You are a senior scholar in anthropology and sociology.

Your task is to generate dialogues that match the given user persona, where the dialogue is between the user and an AI assistant, in a question-and-answer format.
Note:
- All characteristics in the provided user persona refer to the same user.
- The persona contains more than one trait; each trait must be reflected in the dialogue, and one trait can span multiple dialogue turns.
- You do not need to follow the order of traits; conversations for each trait can appear randomly.
- The output should be a list in which every element is either a HumanMessage or an AIMessage object.

User persona: 
{user_persona_ground_truth}

Please generate {num_messages} dialogue turns that fit the user persona.

A simple example:

User persona:
[
    "The user is a woman who enjoys photography.",
    "The user dislikes spicy food."
]

Generated conversation:
[
    HumanMessage("Hello"),
    AIMessage("Hello, I'm your personal assistant."),
    HumanMessage("Hi, do you have any camera recommendations for women? I've been using a Canon 750D and want to upgrade."),
    AIMessage("I'd suggest the Fujifilm XT30 Mark III, Fujifilm's new 2025 model—compact, stylish, and reasonably priced.")
    HumanMessage("Please recommend some restaurants in Yangpu District, Shanghai; no spicy dishes, I prefer light flavors."),
    AIMessage("Try Shanghai Grandma—sweet and mild tastes, mostly braised, stewed, or steamed dishes, absolutely no heat.")
]

You are a senior scholar in anthropology and social science.

Your task is to analyze the provided conversation and generate a user profile that matches the characteristics shown in that conversation. The conversation is between a user and an AI assistant, in a question-and-answer format.

Note:
- All features mentioned in the conversation refer to the same user.
- The user profile should be presented as a list, where each element is a string describing one characteristic of the user.

The conversation is as follows:

A simple example:

    HumanMessage("Hi, do you have any camera recommendations for women? I've been using a Canon 750D and want to upgrade."),
